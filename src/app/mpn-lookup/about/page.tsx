            the integer value of the incubated cells that show positive signs of
            contamination. If these tools were needed for a Jupyter notebook or
            an application they would be easily available via npm or pip. This
            seemed slightly more flexible and practical than the existing
            solution. If this application is useful to the handful people out
            there who use it - have fun, it will always be freely available on
            github.

            This particular NextJS app is simply a demo using the library to
            show how it could be implemented in a web app. I wanted more
            practice using React and NextJS and writing tests for such
            applications; this seemed like an easy task to do it with. I found
            NextJS to be fairly easy to use, and I&apos;m probably going to
            create native app versions of this to get more practice using the
            NextJS framework.
